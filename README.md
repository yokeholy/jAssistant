# jAssistant
*Your personal life management assistant.*

Easily manage your life in these four areas:
- Todo Lists
	- From things you need get done for your family like shopping lists, to work assignments and your own business tasks, it's one place for all.
	- Unlimited number of lists to help you categorize your todos.
	- Create sub-todo tasks if one plain list isn't enough.
	- Add comments when the todo requires more explanation.
	- Highlight todos created longer than certain days.
- Routines
	- Things you do repeatedly.
	- Configure how often of each routine: monthly, weekly, or daily.
	- Keep track of how many consecutive days/weeks/months the routine was done on time.
- Notes
	- Have several notes available at all times is tremendously helpful.
	- Archive a note when no more updates needed for it.
- Lifestyles
	- Need to visually remind yourself to do something several times each day? Lifestyles is the tool for you.
	- Things like drinking enough water, standing up after sitting for a while, and workout everyday, can be easily forgotten. With Lifestyles, you'll see your progress all the time.

#### Privacy Feature
jAssistant is designed to be open in your browser all the time. So when you need to leave your desk, or someone is coming to talk to you, if you don't want your information exposed, there's a show/hide button at the top-right corner to blur everything.
